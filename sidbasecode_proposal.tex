        \begin{abstract}
          An early 8 bit home computer, the Commodore 64, contained
          capable sound synthesis hardware for the the period, but no
          built in software tools to program it with.  Composers were
          required to write low level machine code to fully access the
          sound hardware's features. This resulted in musical
          performances such as game sound tracks, being realized as
          machine code programs, including the ``patches'' (synthesis
          pipeline configuration from moment to moment) and
          score. Over time composers invented new patches and borrowed
          or improved upon the work of others by reverse engineering
          machine code and experimenting with hardware programming
          techniques not anticipated by the manufacturer.  This
          process continues today in the form of a competitive
          ``demoscene'' community.

          It is proposed to make a musicological enumeration and study
          of all known Commodore 64 sound programming techniques,
          detecting and attributing the invention of each technique
          and its variations over time, with an approach inspired by
          the analysis of biological DNA.

          This would be done by automating the analysis of a large
          collection of Commodore 64 music in the High Voltage SID
          Collection (over 55,000 performances), with software
          decompilation and reverse engineering tools developed
          specifically for the purpose.

          Beyond the musicological results, machine learning tools
          would be developed to detect the machine language
          programming techniques characteristic of given composers and
          to generate new machine language programs. These tools may
          inform and advance current discussions on the role of
          generative music and attribution of human composers
          contributions to techniques in AI training datasets. While
          the Commodore 64 is a limited platform, its limitations
          facilitate a complete investigation of its capabilities, and
          may inform further research on automated composer
          attribution generally.

  \section{Introduction}

  At first glance musicological analysis of Commodore 64 music might
  appear simple as the hardware while long out of production is still
  commonplace today and well documented. The Commodore 64 sound
  hardware (the SID chip) contains features familiar to composers
  today - multiple voices each with a choice of waveform, the ability
  to combine waveforms and voices, and software programmable filters,
  and can be completely programmed through 28, 8 bit registers.

  However, given the lack of built in sound software, the hardware can
  only be fully utilized with 6502 machine code, and the hardware has
  variable performance differences even within the same model number,
  particularly in the filters. While popular Commodore 64 emulator,
  VICE, contains a software emulated SID and hardware SID emulators
  exist, the behavior original hardware has proven difficult to
  reproduce exactly and emulator detects continue to be discovered.
  Therefore analysis must include not only methods to work with
  original hardware, but original machine code as well.

  The proposed overall approach, is to develop decompilation tools
  that intercept all calls between a machine language program and an
  emulated SID chip. A call is defined as a point in time, a SID
  register, and the value input (or output - see below) to that
  register).

  The sequence and content of the calls contain the ``patch''
  information (how a voice is being manipulated - for example
  switching from a pulse waveform to a noise waveform within 20ms, to
  produce a percussive sound), as well as score information over a
  longer time scale (for repeated subsequences producing percussive
  sounds at regular intervals).

  These sequences are analogous to DNA - a given performance will
  include sequences programmed by a composer, either of their own
  invention (including re-sequencing from another performance that
  might use similar patches), or sequences recovered from the work of
  others.

  These ``DNA'' sequences can then be indexed across all known
  performances, allowing for variation (both variations that produce
  the same audio output, and variations that produce slightly or
  vastly different output depending on the precise order in which they
  are executed). Also like DNA, these sequences can be recombined and
  edited to produce new sequences, compared between sequences, and a
  given subsequence's effect on audio output can be determined.
%% \subsection{Formatting}

%% The formatting instructions are directed to applicants for the 2024--2025 Bloomberg Data Science Ph.D. Fellowship Application. All applicants are required to adhere to the formatting specifications described in this document. These specifications were created with the intent of providing an equitable format and ensure that applications are similar in length and format.

%% Applicants should adhere to all the formatting instructions described in this document. \textbf{Failure to do so will result in the Fellowship application not being reviewed.} In particular, the should be no changes to page size, spacing, margins and font size as to what is specified in this document.
%% Proposals must be in two-column format, with the exception of the title, applicant name and abstract, which must be centered at the top of the first page, and any full-width figures or tables.

%% Applicants are required to provide a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their proposal in the SoftConf application website (\url{https://www.softconf.com/n/Bloomberg2024/}), together with the CV and the referee names. \textbf{The Fellowship proposal should be no more than two pages of content for PhD Fellowship applications, plus unlimited pages for references.}

%% All figures and tables that are part of the proposal should fit the page limit. A sample figure is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}. A sample table that includes how to cite references is presented in Table~\ref{tbl:tbl1}. We do not allow for submission of additional material such as appendices and supplementary materials like data or code.
