  abstract =	 "{This book explores the development of and the
                  social, cultural, and historical context of
                  chiptune, a form of electronic music that emerged
                  from the first generation of video game consoles and
                  home computers in the 1980s. Through a combination
                  of musical and procedural analysis and practitioner
                  interviews, the book explores the role the technical
                  constraints of early video game hardware played in
                  shaping the sound of 8-bit video game music and the
                  inventive approaches to coding and composition
                  musicians used to circumvent them. It examines the
                  sounds, culture, and personalities behind the music
                  and shows how chiptune links as closely to the music
                  of Bach as to the aggressive posturing of punk or
                  the driving electronic sounds of house. The book
                  begins by looking at chiptune’s roots in video game
                  music and discusses how, as the sound chips that
                  gave rise to its distinctive voice were superseded
                  by more sophisticated hardware, chiptune moved
                  underground to become an important part of the
                  demoscene, a networked community of digital
                  artists. It discusses chiptune’s reemergence in the
                  late 1990s as a new wave of young musicians
                  rediscovered these obsolete machines and began to
                  use them as quirky and characterful musical
                  instruments, in the process taking chiptune from the
                  desktop and placing it centre stage. The book
                  concludes by contemplating what lies ahead; as more
                  people incorporate the chiptune sound into their
                  work, will it ever hit the mainstream or will it
                  remain firmly countercultural as part of the digital
                  underground?}",
